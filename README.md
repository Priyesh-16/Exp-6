Sequence Diagram

1 . Students create an account and log in to the online exam registration system using valid credentials.

2 . The system verifies student details with the database, and only approved students can proceed with registration.

3 . Students register for exams by selecting their subjects or courses, and the system records these registrations.

4 . Students pay exam fees online, after which the system generates digital receipts as proof of payment.

5 . The exam cell schedules and manages exam timetables, ensuring registered students are assigned to the correct exams.

6 . On the exam day, students attend the exams, and faculty invigilate as required.

7 . After the exam, the system generates results and reports automatically, storing them securely for future reference.
